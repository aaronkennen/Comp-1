Purpose: To show how to use Printf to print out a smiley face, while using \\ to print a backslash

Time Spent: About 10-15 min, took longer to get it alligned than to start
Question 1: You will need 18 printf functions for 3 smiley faces.
Question 2: Yes a lot of the printf statements are repeats as you need to print more than one face
Question 3: Only thing i could think of is put one smiley face in a function and then call it 3 times
