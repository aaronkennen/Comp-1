  Purpose: The purpose is to show what the executable path would be for the program, incase you need to run command line
           arguments. Also it shows the functionality of printf and %s as well as seeing that argv[0] is ./a.out
  
  Sources of Help: The Day2.pdf and my brain
  
  Time Spent: About 10 minutes, took more time copying the code and writing this than understanding what it does.
